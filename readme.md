## My install Bash script for Vagrant.
Much like [Jeffrey Way](https://github.com/JeffreyWay/Vagrant-Setup), [Eric Barnes](https://github.com/ericbarnes/Vagrant-Setup) and [Josh Manders](https://github.com/killswitch/Vagrant-Setup), this is my version of Jeffrey's Vagrant Setup.

The same as [Josh Manders'](https://github.com/killswitch/Vagrant-Setup) (with Nginx) but with my editions:
* Debian (wheezy64)
* Redis
* Updated shared folders mount (as of I've experienced problems with permissions with original setup)
* Private network on IP 33.33.33.33
* In Vagrantfile set DB creation flag and DBNAME (defaults to true and 'database') to create DB after provision

If establishing of private network causes errors in VirtualBox, run (if on Mac):
```
sudo /Library/StartupItems/VirtualBox/VirtualBox restart
```
(see https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/issues/2392#issuecomment-27367698)
